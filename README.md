- 👋 Hi, I am Gonçalo. I am a User Experience Designer with a background in pastry and customer service. I’m creative and have a particular eye for detail to find usability problems.
- 👀 My background in hospitality has taught me the importance of collaborating with team members and stakeholders, multitasking while under a lot of pressure, and processing and implementing feedback to achieve the best possible outcome. Working in customer service has also taught me to be adaptable, and empathetic to different user needs and wants.
- 🌱 I’m curious and passionate about everything I do, and I look forward to making an impact in this world and applying my skills and experience to create intuitive digital products more human-centered.
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for a Junior UX Design Position.
